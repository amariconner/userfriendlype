**Recommendation: tell audience what they need to do with actionable statements.**

* Use active voice and "you" statements, i.e., *"You need to..."* or *"Talk with your doctor about..."*

**Recommendation: Limit negatives like “do not” or “should not;" instead, emphasize what the audience should do.**

* Some "do nots" are unavoidable - try using bulleted lists to separate "do's" and "don'ts" so the audience can easily reference instructions.

**Recommendation: Limit use of statistics.**

* Instead of numbers and percents, use more general terms to emphasize the meaning, i.e., *"nearly all...," "rarely...,"* or *"half..."* 
* Put statistics in parentheses if you feel they are necessary to include, i.e. *"In almost all cases (95%)..."*

**Recommendation: Use visuals to help explain the text.**

* Make sure visuals are explanatory/relevant to the text.
* Use visuals with minimal lablels that only highlight relevant pieces of information.
* Use captions to highlight the key message of the visual
* Use visuals to reinforce actions that the audience should take rather than what the audience should not do.
