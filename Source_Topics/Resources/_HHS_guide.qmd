**Recommendation: Always use language that is familiar to your users.**

* Avoid medical jargon
* Use less technical word choices wherever possible, i.e., use *"cut"* as opposed to *"incision."*

**Recommendation: Put the most important information first.**

* If the audience needs to make a decision about getting a surgery, place the decision-making factors at the beginning of the document and procedural details at the bottom.

**Recommendation: Think “need to know” vs. “nice to know”.**

* Consider which technical details may not be useful to the audience.
* Patient education is supposed to be supplemental; therefore, patients can seek more details from their primary care provider or specialists.
